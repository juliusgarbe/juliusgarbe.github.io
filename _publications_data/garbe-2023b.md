This is the [PISM](https://www.pism.io/ "https://www.pism.io/") code version used for the Antarctic Ice Sheet simulations published and discussed in [Garbe, J., Zeitz, M., Krebs-Kanzow, U., Winkelmann, R. The evolution of future Antarctic surface melt using PISM-dEBM-simple. The Cryosphere 17, 4571â€“4599, 2023.](https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4571-2023 "https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4571-2023").<br />
The code is based on PISM release `v1.2`, but contains several improvements and modifications.<br />
