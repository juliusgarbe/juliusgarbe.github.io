## Abstract
Over geological time scales, the combination of solid-Earth deformation and climate-dependent surface processes have resulted in a distinct hypsometry (distribution of surface area with elevation), with the highest concentration of surface area focused near the present-day sea surface. However, the maximum is not situated exactly at sea-surface level as expected but is found ~5.5 m above. Here we explore the nature of this distinct feature in Earth's hypsometry and examine how it evolved over the last glacial cycle and may evolve moving towards a near-ice-free future. We find that the current elevation of Earth's hypsometric maximum cannot be explained by ongoing sea-level adjustments following the last glacial cycle. Instead, we suggest that global sea level must have been higher by ~11 m for a significant portion of Earth's recent multi-million-year history. This signifies that our current polar ice-sheet and sea-level state (and our global reference level) is not the norm and should be considered an anomaly in a geological perspective.
