## Abstract
Over geological time scales, the combination of solid-Earth deformation and climate-dependent surface processes have resulted in a distinct hypsometry on Earth (distribution of surface area with elevation), with the highest concentration of surface area focused near the present-day sea surface. However, in addition to a single, well-defined maximum at the present-day sea surface, Earth's hypsometry is also characterized by a prominent maximum ~5 m above this level. Here we explore the nature of this 5-m maximum and examine how it evolved over the last glacial cycle and may evolve moving towards a near-ice-free future. We find that the 5-m hypsometric maximum cannot be explained by ongoing sea-level adjustments following the last glacial cycle. Instead, we suggest that global sea level must have been higher for a significant portion of Earth's recent multi-million-year history, by as much as ~9 m in the absence of erosional and depositional processes, in order to bring the current 5-m maximum to the sea surface. This signifies that our current sea-level state (and our global reference level) may be anomalous over longer time scales in a geological perspective.
