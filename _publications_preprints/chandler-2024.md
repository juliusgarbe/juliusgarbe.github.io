## Abstract
Ice loss from Antarctica's vast freshwater reservoir could threaten coastal communities and the global economy if the ice volume decreases by just a few percent. Key processes controlling the fine balance between ice gain and ice loss remain poorly constrained, so that Antarctica's contribution to future sea-level changes ranks as the most uncertain of all potential contributors. Meanwhile, observed changes in mass balance are limited to ~40 years and difficult to put into context for an ice sheet with response time scales reaching centuries to millennia. To gain a much longer-term perspective, we here combine transient and equilibrium Parallel Ice Sheet Model simulations of Antarctic Ice Sheet response to repeated glacial-interglacial warming and cooling cycles over the last 800,000 years. We find hysteresis (path-dependent states) that is caused both by the long response time and by crossing of tipping points. Notably, West Antarctic Ice Sheet collapse contributes over 4 m sea-level rise in all equilibrium ice sheet states with little (0.25Â°C) or even no ocean warming above present. Therefore, we are likely already at (or almost at) an 'overshoot' scenario, supporting recent studies warning of ubstantial irreversible ice loss on millennial time-scales with little or no further climate warming.
